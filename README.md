# üí´ About Me:
As a final-year Computer Science student at UPES, I have always been driven by a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges. My journey with coding began in high school, where I developed a strong foundation in Python. Since then, I‚Äôve expanded my expertise across a broad range of technologies, including full-stack development and cloud infrastructure.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects‚Äîfrom building scalable APIs and e-commerce platforms to conducting research on mental workload classification at DRDO using deep learning. My experience spans automation, IoT, and web development, where I‚Äôve become proficient in both frontend and backend technologies, along with cloud platforms like AWS.

Key Strengths & Expertise:

 ‚Ä¢ DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure: Hands-on experience with AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, Fargate), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and infrastructure automation (Terraform).
 ‚Ä¢ Backend & Frontend Development: Proficient in Node.js, Express, React, and Nest.js, with a focus on building secure, scalable, and efficient web applications.
 ‚Ä¢ Leadership & Collaboration: Led development teams for several projects, including at Carnaama, where I oversaw the creation of production-ready APIs and seamless integrations for an e-commerce platform.

My specialization in DevOps has allowed me to gain a deep understanding of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, cloud-based solutions, and infrastructure management‚Äîall of which I‚Äôm keen to further explore and master as I pursue my career in this field.

Beyond my technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy taking on leadership roles where I can guide teams towards successful project outcomes. I‚Äôm constantly seeking opportunities to learn, adapt, and apply my skills in ways that make a tangible impact.

I‚Äôm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, exploring new opportunities, and contributing to innovative projects in the tech space.
