# üí´ About Me:
Hey there! üëã I'm a third-year computer science student at UPES, and I've been captivated by computers since I was young. I've always had a knack for problem-solving and finding real-world solutions, which naturally led me to start coding. Ever since then, I've been hooked!<br><br>I kicked off my coding journey back in 11th grade with Python, and I've gained over three years of experience with the language. Throughout my coding adventures, I've worked on various projects, from automation and IoT to creating fully-fledged websites and diving into full-stack development. Apart from Python, I've also dabbled in C, Java, and front-end development because my aim is to become a full-stack engineer.<br><br>Currently, I'm specializing in DevOps at UPES and have gained a good understanding of common DevOps tools. My ultimate goal is to become a DevOps engineer, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing in this field.<br><br>But it's not just my technical skills that make me stand out. I'm also a great communicator and thrive in leadership roles. I'm eager to gain valuable experience in professional workplace environments and use my skills to help companies achieve their goals.<br><br>In a nutshell, I'm an enthusiastic and driven individual with a deep passion for coding, problem-solving, and creating user-friendly interfaces. I'm thrilled to continue expanding my skill set, and right now, I'm actively learning JavaScript, Node.js, and working with databases.<br><br>Let's connect and make a positive impact in the tech industry together!
